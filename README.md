### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

  Yes it helped alot
  I really had a difficult time at first with JavaScript but the more i got to do it the more i understood. The labs was of     great help and the project was very compherensive


* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
  Yes, I would definitely create a better looking and more interactive website.
  I could not have the extension on my company's laptop VS code to organise my intentations

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try   next time?

  This is the first time i ever build a website and i am very impressed of what i could acheive in a week with Codepath and my instructor's assistance. Jakie did an awesome    job explaining the material
